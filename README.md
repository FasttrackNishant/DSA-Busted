# DSA-Busted

A collection of Data Structures and Algorithms problems solved in C++ (and other languages).  
Each solution follows the **Brute → Better → Optimal** approach with clear code and explanations.

## 📁 Structure
- `C++/` – Core DSA problems and patterns  
- `Java/` – Optional Java versions  
- `Old_DSA/` – Earlier solved Problems - College Time Buddy !  

## 🧠 Focus
- Strengthen problem-solving for **interviews**  
- Practice key patterns (Arrays, Trees, Graphs, DP, etc.)  
- Understand time and space complexity intuitively  

## 🚀 Usage
Clone the repo and explore problems by topic:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FasttrackNishant/DSA-Busted.git
